"""
This script is designed to send messages and images to a Telegram channel using the python-telegram-bot library.

It includes functions to:

    - send text messages (send_telegram)
        Utility: to inform me of issues to address regarding influencer management:
            - Scheduled videos about to run out for influencer X
            - Influencer X needs to complete the authentication workflow
            - Influencer X is running out of videos, more production is needed
        This saves me from having to be vigilant about issues, and simply be alerted to them.
