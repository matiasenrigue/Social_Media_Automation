## Warning: Private Files

Please note that two files have been kept private due to their proprietary nature:

### 1. `Video_Recording.py`
- **Functions:**
  - `def video_editing_YT() -> None`
    - **Description:** Assembles images, audio, and subtitles while adding effects to maintain viewers' attention.
    - **Tool Used:** `moviepy`

### 2. `Thumbnails_Shorts.py`
- **Functions:**
  - `def industrial_thumbnails(Influencer: object, folder: os.path) -> None`
    - **Description:** Creates TikTok-style thumbnails for videos with text generated by an AI model.
    - **Tool Used:** `PIL`


## Reasons for Exclusion

The video editing style and thumbnail design are unique elements I have developed to make my videos stand out from other AI automation projects. I believe it is fair to keep these proprietary aspects private to maintain the distinctiveness of my content.
