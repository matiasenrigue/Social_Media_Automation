"""
This script is designed to automate video production workflows for influencers, encompassing tasks from initial title generation to final video editing and uploading. It includes two primary workflows:

From Title to Video:
- This workflow generates complete videos from a given title with minimal supervision.
- It is ideal when the title prompt is well-optimized and requires minimal manual intervention.

Conservative Re-editing:
- This workflow focuses on re-editing videos that have been sent back for corrections.
- It is designed to handle videos at an advanced stage, ensuring they meet quality standards before final publishing.
