# SocialMediaAutomation

Public version of my private repo Social_Media_Automation

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate my Python development skills through a comprehensive package, showcasing its structure.

## Demo:

In this [YouTube link](https://youtu.be/PpNS5vbUkyI), I show how my project works.

## Usage

**Management.py**: For managing the various influencers' profiles:
- Getting topics for new videos
- Organizing folders
- Bulk downloading pictures

**Mass_production.py**:
- Produce videos in bulk from the received topics
- Re-edit videos in bulk if you are supervising the produced videos and making adjustments
- Approve videos without supervision before uploading (I don't supervise the videos before uploading)

**Videos.py**: In case you want more control and supervision (I don't use it):
- Edit parts of the video (script, images, narration, etc.)
- Choose thumbnails
- Approve/deny videos to have more control over what gets posted

### PS: Before using it:

The code can be used to develop a comprehensive mass production system for AI influencer videos. However, as I worked hard for months on this project, I hid the following components to ensure the uniqueness of my videos is not easily replicated:
- Prompts for my videos
- Editing style of my videos
- Thumbnail style of my videos

These three components can be easily substituted by following these tutorials:
- Prompt engineering for LLM 
- MoviePy for editing video style
- PIL for thumbnail style of the pictures

My project provides the template on which to build such automation:
- Manage folder structure
- Manage video production logic
- Etc.
